# The Vanilla Gradient Descent Method for Linear Regression

This repo contain pedagogical and introductory implementations of the _Vanilla Gradient Descent Method_.

1. ![The Jupyter Notebook contains examples and testing of the implementation.](https://nbviewer.org/github/falken1983/linreg_grad_descent/blob/main/gradient_descent_mse.ipynb)
2. The MATLAB implementation is an equivalent implementation with just a demo on the header.

The Jupyter Notebook and the Python module also contains the estimation of the linear regression coefficients by means of the _Normal Equations_. 
The translation into a MATLAB function is straightforward.
