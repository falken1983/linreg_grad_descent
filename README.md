# The Vanilla Gradient Descent Method for Linear Regression

This repo contain a pedagogical and introductory implementations of the _Vanilla Gradient Descent Method_.

1. The jupyter notebook contains examples and testing of the implementation.
2. The MATLAB implementation is an equivalent implementation with just a demo on the header.

The jupyter notebook and the python module also contains the linear regressi√≥n estimation by means of the _Normal Equations_. The translation into a MATLAB function is straightforward.
